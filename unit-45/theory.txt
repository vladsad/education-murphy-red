Who saw you? Who did you see? (questions 2)

In these questions, who/what is the subject:
    Who lives in this house? (= somebody lives in it – who?)
        (not Who does live?)
    What happened? (= something happened – what?)
        (not What did happen?)
    What’s happening? (What’s = What is)
    Who’s got my key? (Who’s = Who has)

In these questions, who/what is the object:
    Who did you meet yesterday? (= you met somebody – who?)
    What did Paul say? (= Paul said something – what?)
    Who are you phoning?
    What was Silvia wearing?

Use who for people (somebody). Use what for things, ideas etc. (something)
