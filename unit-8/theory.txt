Present continuous (I am doing) = now, at the time of speaking

Present simple (I do) = in general, all the time or sometimes

We do not use these verbs in the present continuous (I am â€“ing):
    like
    want
    know
    understand
    remember
    prefer
    need
    mean
    believe
    forget

Use only the present simple with these verbs (I want / do you like? etc.)
