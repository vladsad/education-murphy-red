too/either   so am i / neither do i etc..

We use too and either at the end of a sentence:
    We use too after a positive verb:
        Jane is a doctor. Her husband is a doctor too
    We use either after a negative verb:
        Ben doesn’t watch TV. He doesn’t read newspapers either

so am I = I am too
so have I = I have too (etc.)

neither am I = I’m not either
neither can I = I can’t either (etc.):
    You can also use Nor (= Neither):
    Nor am I. or Neither am I.

!!Remember: So am I (not So I am), Neither have I (not Neither I have)!!
