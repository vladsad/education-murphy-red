I am, i dont' etc...

am/is/are
was/were
have/has
do/does/did
can
will
might
must

We don’t use ’m/’s/’ve etc. (short forms) in this way. You must use am/is/have etc. :
    She isn’t tired, but he is. (not but he’s)

But you can use isn’t / haven’t / won’t etc. (negative short forms):
    My sister has got a car, but I haven’t.

You can use I am / I’m not etc. after Yes and No

We use do/does for the present simple
We use did for the past simple
