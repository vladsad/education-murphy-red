I’m going to ...

We use am/is/are going to ... for the future:
    I           am  do ...
    he/she/it   is  drink ...
    we/you/they are watch ...

    am I                  eat..?
    is he/she/it going to buy..?
    are                   wear..?

I am going to do something = I have decided to do it, my intention is to do it

We also use the present continuous (I am doing) for the future, usually for arrangements:
    I am playing tennis with Julia tomorrow.

Something is going to happen = we can see now that it is sure to happen:
    Look at the sky! It’s going to rain. (black clouds now → rain)
    Oh dear! It’s 9 o’clock and I’m not ready. I’m going to be late. (9 o’clock now and not ready → late)
