might

might + infinitive (might go / might be / might rain etc.):
    i/she/he/it/they/we/    might (not)     be, play, swim ...

I might = it is possible that I will
I might not = it is possible that I will not

You can use may in the same way. I may = I might

May I ... ? = Is it OK to ... ? / Can I ... ?
