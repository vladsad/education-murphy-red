should

should + infinitive (should do/ should watch etc.):

You should do something = it is a good thing to do, it is the right thing to do

You shouldn’t do something = it is not a good thing to do. Shouldn’t = should not

We often say I think ... should ...
    I think ... should ...
    I don’t think ... should ...
    Do you think ... should ... ?:

Must is stronger than should!

Another way to say should is ought to
