Regular and irregular verbs

The past simple and past participle of regular verbs is -ed:
    clean → cleaned
    live → lived
    paint → painted
    study → studied

Past participle
    have/has + past participle (present perfect → Units 15–18):
    be (is/are/were/has been etc.) + past participle (passive → Units 21–22): These rooms are cleaned every day.

The past simple and past participle of irregular verbs do not end in -ed:
                        make break  cut
    past simple         made broke  cut
    past participle     made broken cut

Sometimes the past simple and past participle are the same. For example:
    past simple         make find  buy    cut
    past participle     made found bought cut

Sometimes the past simple and past participle are different. For example:
                        break  know  begin go
    past simple         broke  knew  began went
    past participle     broken known begun gone
