will/shall 2

You can use I’ll ... (I will) when you offer something or decide to do something:
    ‘My bag is very heavy.’ ‘I’ll carry it for you.’
    ‘I’ll phone you tomorrow, OK?’ ‘OK, bye.’

We often say I think I’ll ... / I don’t think I’ll ... when we decide to do something:
    I’m tired. I think I’ll go to bed early tonight.
    It’s a nice day. I think I’ll sit outside.
    It’s raining. I don’t think I’ll go out.

!!!Do not use the present simple (I go / I phone etc.) in sentences like these:
    I’ll phone you tomorrow, OK? (not I phone you)
    I think I’ll go to bed early. (not I go to bed)

!!!Do not use I’ll ... for something you decided before:
    I’m working tomorrow. (not I’ll work)
    I don’t want my car any more. I’m going to sell it. (not I’ll sell)
    What are you doing at the weekend? (not What will you do)

Shall I / Shall we ... ? = Do you think this is a good thing to do? Do you think this is a good idea?
    It’s very warm in this room. Shall I open the window?
    ‘Shall I phone you this evening?’ ‘Yes, please.’
    I’m going to a party tonight. What shall I wear?
    It’s a nice day. Shall we go for a walk?
    Where shall we go for our holidays this year?
    ‘Let’s go out this evening.’ ‘OK, what time shall we meet?’
