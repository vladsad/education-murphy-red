will/shall 1

will + infinitive (will be / will win / will come etc.):
                                     be
    I/we/you/they  will (’ll)        win
    he/she/it      will not (won’t)  eat
                                     come

    will I/we/you/they/he/she/it win?

’ll = will: I’ll (I will) / you’ll / she’ll etc.
won’t = will not: I won’t (= I will not) / you won’t / she won’t etc.

We often say I think ... will ... :
    I think Kelly will pass the exam.
    I don’t think it will rain this afternoon.
    Do you think the exam will be difficult?

We do not use will for things we have already arranged or decided to do:
    We’re going to the cinema on Saturday. Do you want to come with us? (not We will go)
    I’m not working tomorrow. (not I won’t work)
    Are you going to do the exam? (not Will you do)

shall
    You can say I shall (= I will) and WE shall (= we will):
        I shall be late tomorrow.   or   I will (I’ll) be late tomorrow.
        I think we shall win.       or   I think we will (we’ll) win.
    !!!But do not use shall with you/they/he/she/it!!!:
        Tom will be late. (not Tom shall be)
