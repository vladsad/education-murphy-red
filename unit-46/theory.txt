Who is she talking to? What is it like? (questions 3)

In questions beginning Who ... ? / What ... ? / Where ... ? / Which ... ?,
prepositions (to/from/with etc.) usually go at the end

What’s it like? = What is it like? What’s it like? = tell me something
about it – is it good or bad, big or small, old or new (etc.)?

When we say ‘What is it like?’, like is a preposition.
It is not the verb like (‘Do you like your new house?’ etc.)
