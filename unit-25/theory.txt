What are you doing tomorrow?

We use am/is/are + -ing (present continuous) for something happening now

We also use am/is/are + -ing for the future (tomorrow / next week etc.)

I am doing something tomorrow = I have arranged to do it, I have a plan to do it

We use the present continuous (I’m staying / are you coming etc.) to say what somebody has arranged to do

But we use the present simple (start, arrives etc.) for timetables, programmes, trains, buses etc.

present continuous (usually for people)        present simple (for timetables, programmes etc.)
    I’m going to a concert tomorrow.                The concert starts at 7.30.
    What time are you leaving?                      What time does your train leave?
