We use than after comparatives (older than ../more expensive than .. etc)

We usually say: than me/ than him/ than her/than us/than them:
    You can run faster than him     or      You can run faster than he can 
    You are a better singer than me     or      You are a better singer than i am 
    I gop up earlier than her       or      I got up earlier than she did 

more/less than:
    The fil was very short - less than an hour 
    They have more money that they need
    You go out more than me 

a bit   bigger
much    older
        better          than ..
        more difficult
        more expensive
