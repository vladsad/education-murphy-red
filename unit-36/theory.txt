I used to ...

Dave used to work in a factory. Now he works in a supermarket.

You can say I used to work ... / she used to have ... / they used to be ... etc. :
    I/you/we/they/he/she/it     used to        be/work/have/play...

The negative is I didn’t use to ...

The question is did you use to ... ?

We use used to ... only for the past. You cannot say ‘I use to ...’ for the present
